2 different firmware
    one for devices wiwithoutth psram (Heltec / TTGO-Lora)
    one for devices with psram (TTGO T-Beam V07 V1.0 V1.1)
when loading wrong version device may hang in a infinite loop

V1.5.1
Bugfix on Wifi-Connect setting

V1.5.2
Bugfix random Crash caused by i2c

V1.5.3
Fixed issue with ogn (gliderradar.com)
added db to send-values for OGN-received aircrafts
set wifi-reconnect-timeout 60sec. --> 10min. --> so it should be possible to connect via hotspot and change settings.

V1.5.4
new calculation of snr- for ogn.
As Lora, the snr-value goes from -10dB to 20dB we send the inverted rssi-signal, where 120 ist best and 0 is worst signal strength.

V1.6.0
Added legacy-Mode
added Traccar tracking

V1.7.0
Legacy-Mode Bugfix --> now working directly with OGN-Ground-Station (Raspberry-pi and RTL-SDR-Dongle)
BME280 and BMP280 are now supported as baro-sensor.
in Ground-Station-Mode weather-data can be transmitted, if a BME280 is connected to the baro-pins (wind-sensor is not yet implemented)
hostname will be set, so you can ping the device with gxaircom-07XXXX (XXXX --> device-id)
improved screen switching (is now much faster (more responsive))

increased mtu-size for ble
battery-empty delay of 60seconds --> battery-voltage has to be 60sec. below min. then poweroff is triggered.

V1.9.1
added 3min. delay after startup for powersave, to have a chance to change settings.

V2.1.0
added accelerometer for better vario
added temp-offset for vario
added config-button for ublox-GPS --> only GPGGA and GPRMC will sent --> much less traffic
added new configuration extpw (external power switch on Pin 36) --> to use directly in kobo (without display)

V2.2.0
added new setting to set FANET-Mode (always air-mode / switch between air-mode and ground-mode).
sending ground-tracking-data to OGN
sending weather-data to OGN
forward ground-tracking-data to OGN
forward fanet-name to OGN

V3.0.0
!!!! ATTENTION !!!
